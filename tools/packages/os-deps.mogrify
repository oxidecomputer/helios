# Each "transform" rule acts on a specific pkg(5) action, such as a "depend"
# or a "file" entry.  In this file, we wish to trim out a few specific
# dependencies from a few specific packages.  Unfortunately, pkgmogrify
# only allows for matching action-level attributes (e.g., "type" and "fmri" for
# a "depend" action) in predicates, but we want to be able to match on
# the FMRI of the package which contains the "depend" entries we wish to drop.
#
# To work around this limitation, we add a temporary action-level attribute
# to _every_ depend entry, using the value expansion pattern match %{...},
# which _does_ have access to pacakage-level attributes.
#
<transform depend -> default tmp.fmri %{pkg.fmri}>

#
# We can then match on specific FMRI values and assign them a removal bank
# number.
#

#
# Bank 1: system/file-system/zfs depends on a Python runtime directly because
# it contains a vestigial script, "/usr/lib/zfs/pyzfs.py".  Drop those
# dependencies for now until we have a chance to clean up the gate:
#
<transform depend tmp.fmri=pkg://[^/]*/system/file-system/zfs@.* \
    -> default X 1>
<transform depend X=1 type=require fmri=.*/library/python/zfs-.* -> drop>
<transform depend X=1 type=require fmri=.*/library/python/solaris-.* -> drop>
<transform depend X=1 type=require fmri=.*runtime/python-.* -> drop>

#
# Bank 2: mailwrapper depends on sendmail directly, but we do not wish sendmail
# installed.  Drop the dependency, so that mail will at least fail to be
# delivered rather than litter the system.
#
<transform depend tmp.fmri=pkg://[^/]*/system/network/mailwrapper@.* \
    -> default X 2>
<transform depend X=2 type=require fmri=.*sendmail.* -> drop>

#
# Bank 3: In fact, let's not require mailwrapper at all.
#
<transform depend tmp.fmri=pkg://[^/]*/SUNWcs@.* \
    -> default X 3>
<transform depend X=3 type=require fmri=.*/mailwrapper.* -> drop>

#
# Unconditionally drop our temporary attributes so that they do not then appear
# in the manifest output:
#
<transform depend X=.* -> delete X .*>
<transform depend tmp.fmri=.* -> delete tmp.fmri .*>
