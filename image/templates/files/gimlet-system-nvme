* The default NVMe admin command timeout is one second. We have observed that,
* from the driver's perspective, the SN840 drives in a gimlet occasionally take
* over two seconds to respond to a log page request. When the request times out
* (after the first second), an abort is sent which also times out resulting in
* the device being marked as dead by the driver.
* Pending upstream driver work to improve things, we bump the timeout.
