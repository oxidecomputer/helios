* Normally, the dbuf cache is 1/32nd of RAM and the dbuf metadata cache is
* 1/64th of RAM.  On a 1TiB system, these are way, way too big for us --
* especially with 800GiB already spoken for.  Moreover, the primary advantage
* of the dbuf cache -- namely, eliminate the cost of uncompression on a dbuf
* cache hit -- is negated by the non-compressability for Crucible data (which
* is encrypted).  We therefore tune these numbers down quite a bit, knowing
* that any eviction from the dbuf cache can still be in the ARC.

* By default, ZFS tries to internally aggregate multiple I/O operations, so it
* can dispatch them as a single operation to the disk.  This logic comes from
* the era of spinning drives, where putting in the work to issue fewer, larger
* commands would increase throughput.  For SSDs, and especially the compute
* sled SSDs, it instead generates extra work within ZFS that reduces
* throughput.
*
* We set the limit to 0 disable aggregation entirely.

* These task queues will allocate threads equal to 75% of the number of CPU
* threads on the system.  On Gimlet, for example, that means that it allocates
* 96 threads.  These queues are per-zpool, so actually that means it allocates
* 960 threads by default.  This is a bit excessive.  These parameters bring it
* down to allocate 5% per pool instead, significantly reducing mutex contention
* between the worker threads.
