#
# This file contains tunable parameters for dhcpagent(1M).
#

# All parameters can be tuned for a specific interface by prepending
# the interface name to the parameter name.  For example, to make
# VERIFIED_LEASE_ONLY happen on all interfaces except hme0, specify:
#
# hme0.VERIFIED_LEASE_ONLY=no
# VERIFIED_LEASE_ONLY=yes
#
# An interface name alone specifies IPv4 DHCP.  For DHCPv6, append ".v6".
# Some examples:
#
# hme0.VERIFIED_LEASE_ONLY=no		specify hme0 v4 behavior
# hme0.v6.VERIFIED_LEASE_ONLY=no	specify hme0 v6 behavior
# VERIFIED_LEASE_ONLY=no		match all v4 interfaces
# .v6.VERIFIED_LEASE_ONLY=no		match all v6 interfaces

# By default, when the DHCP agent is sent a SIGTERM (typically when
# the system is shut down), all managed addresses are dropped rather
# than released.  Dropping an address does not notify the DHCP server
# that the address is no longer in use, leaving it possibly available
# for subsequent use by the same client.  If DHCP is later restarted
# on the interface, the client will ask the server if it can continue
# to use the address.  If the server either grants the request, or
# does not answer (and the lease has not yet expired), then the client
# will use the original address.
#
# Similarly, when the system is suspended and then woken up or when
# the link status transitions from down to up, DHCP will ask the server
# to continue to use the managed address, in case the lease has changed.
#
# By uncommenting the following parameter-value pairs, all managed
# addresses are released on SIGTERM instead, and any that may have been
# saved but cannot be verified will not be used.  When SIGTERM is
# received, the DHCP server is notified that the address is available
# for use, and the address will not be saved for a later restart.  If
# DHCP receives SIGTHAW or a link-up event, DHCP will attempt to verify
# the previous lease, but if unable to do so, it will not attempt to
# use that lease.  This behavior is often preferred for roaming systems.
#
# VERIFIED_LEASE_ONLY=yes
# .v6.VERIFIED_LEASE_ONLY=yes

# By default, the DHCP agent waits 3 seconds to collect OFFER
# responses to a DISCOVER.  If it receives no OFFERs in this time, it
# then waits for another 3 seconds, and so forth.  To change this
# behavior, set and uncomment the following parameter-value pair.
# Note: this does not control the retransmission strategy for
# DISCOVERs, which is formally specified in RFC 2131.  This parameter
# is specified in seconds.
#
# OFFER_WAIT=

# By default, the DHCP agent does not send out a client identifier
# (and hence, the chaddr field is used by the DHCP server as the
# client identifier.)  To make the DHCP agent send a client
# identifier, set and uncomment the following parameter-value pair.
# Note that by default this is treated as an NVT ASCII string.  To
# specify a binary value, prepend "0x" to a sequence of hexadecimal
# digits (for example, the value 0xAABBCC11 would set the client
# identifier to the 4-byte binary sequence 0xAA 0xBB 0xCC 0x11).
#
# CLIENT_ID=

# By default, for an IPv4 interface that is not in an IP network
# multipathing (IPMP) group, that is not IP over InfiniBand (IPoIB), and
# that is not a logical interface, the DHCP agent will forgo sending a
# client identifier unless CLIENT_ID is defined.
#
# To use a system-managed, RFC 3315-style (i.e., DHCPv6-style) binding
# identifier as documented in RFC 4361, "Node-specific Client Identifiers
# for DHCPv4," for all IPv4 interfaces (unless CLIENT_ID is defined),
# uncomment the following line.
#
# V4_DEFAULT_IAID_DUID=yes

# By default, the DHCP agent will try to request the Fully Qualified Domain
# Name (FQDN) currently associated with the interface performing DHCP.  The
# hostname is defined by using the -h,--reqhost option of ipadm(1M) or the
# ncu ip-reqhost property of nwamcfg(1M) or by flagging the interface as
# primary so that nodename(4) is used as the hostname.
#
# A defined hostname will be used as the FQDN if it is "rooted" (i.e., if
# it ends with a '.') or if it consists of at least three DNS labels (e.g.,
# srv.example.com).  If the hostname is not an FQDN, then DNS_DOMAINNAME
# will be appended if defined or ADOPT_DOMAINNAME discernment will be used
# if active.  If no FQDN can be determined, the option will not be used.
#
# If this REQUEST_FQDN option is enabled, an FQDN will be sent in messages
# to the DHCP server along with RFC 4702 options to request that a
# collaborating DNS server perform DNS updates for A and PTR resource
# records.  To prevent sending FQDN and DNS options, uncomment the line
# below.
#
# If an FQDN is sent, REQUEST_HOSTNAME processing will not be done, per RFC
# 4702 (3.1):  "clients that send the Client FQDN option in their messages
# MUST NOT also send the Host Name."
#
# REQUEST_FQDN=no

# By default, the DHCP agent will not attempt to construct an FQDN from a
# PQDN specified by the -h,--reqhost option of ipadm(1M), by the ncu
# ip-reqhost property of nwamcfg(1M), or by nodename(4).  Set and
# uncomment the following parameter to indicate a domain name to be used by
# the DHCP agent to construct if necessary an FQDN.
#
# DNS_DOMAINNAME=

# By default, the DHCP agent will not attempt to use a domain name returned
# by the DHCP server or the domain in resolv.conf(4) to construct an FQDN
# from a PQDN specified by the -h,--reqhost option of ipadm(1M), by the ncu
# ip-reqhost property of nwamcfg(1M), or by nodename(4).  Set and uncomment
# the following parameter to indicate that a returned DHCPv4 DNSdmain or the
# domain from resolv.conf(4) should be adopted by the DHCP agent to
# construct if necessary an FQDN.
#
# ADOPT_DOMAINNAME=yes

# By default, the DHCP agent will try to request the hostname currently
# associated with the interface performing DHCP.  If this option is
# enabled, the agent will attempt to use an -h,--reqhost option saved with
# ipadm(1M) or an ncu ip-reqhost property set with nwamcfg(1M); or else
# attempt to find a host name in /etc/hostname.<if>, which must contain a
# line of the form
#
#	inet name
#
# where "name" is a single RFC 1101-compliant token; or else use
# nodename(4) for a DHCP interface flagged as primary.  If found in any of
# these configurations, the token will be used to request that host name
# from the DHCP server.  To prevent this, uncomment the following line.
#
# REQUEST_HOSTNAME=no

# By default, a parameter request list requesting a subnet mask (1),
# router (3), DNS server (6), hostname (12), DNS domain (15), broadcast
# address (28), and encapsulated vendor options (43), is sent to the DHCP
# server when the DHCP agent sends requests.  However, if desired, this
# can be changed by altering the following parameter-value pair.  The
# numbers correspond to the values defined in the IANA bootp-dhcp-parameters
# registry at the time of this writing.  Site and standard option names from
# /etc/dhcp/inittab are also accepted.
#
PARAM_REQUEST_LIST=1,3,6,12,15,28,43

# The default DHCPv6 parameter request list has preference (7), unicast (12),
# DNS addresses (23), DNS search list (24), NIS addresses (27), and
# NIS domain (29).  This may be changed by altering the following parameter-
# value pair.  The numbers correspond to the values defined in the IANA
# dhcpv6-parameters registry at the time of this writing.  Site and standard
# option names from /etc/dhcp/inittab6 are also accepted.
.v6.PARAM_REQUEST_LIST=7,12,23,24,27,29

# The parameter ignore list allows you to instruct the DHCP client to discard
# optional parameters received from the DHCP server.  The format is the same
# as the request list above.  When discarded, a parameter will not be acted
# on by the DHCP client or returned to users via the dhcpinfo(1) command.
PARAM_IGNORE_LIST=12
