* Normally, the dbuf cache is 1/32nd of RAM and the dbuf metadata cache is
* 1/64th of RAM.  On a 1TiB system, these are way, way too big for us --
* especially with 800GiB already spoken for.  Moreover, the primary advantage
* of the dbuf cache -- namely, eliminate the cost of uncompression on a dbuf
* cache hit -- is negated by the non-compressability for Crucible data (which
* is encrypted).  We therefore tune these numbers down quite a bit, knowing
* that any eviction from the dbuf cache can still be in the ARC.
