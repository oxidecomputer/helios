* This is the /etc/system.d/zfs:dbuf file for Gimlet, which is pulled in as
* part of the image creation process for Helios; it cannot be modified in situ.

*
* Normally, the dbuf cache is 1/32nd of RAM and the dbuf metadata cache is
* 1/64th of RAM.  On a 1TiB system, these are way, way too big for us --
* especially with 800GiB already spoken for.  Moreover, the primary advantage
* of the dbuf cache -- namely, eliminate the cost of uncompression on a dbuf
* cache hit -- is negated by the non-compressability for Crucible data (which
* is encrypted).  We therefore tune these numbers down quite a bit, knowing
* that any eviction from the dbuf cache can still be in the ARC.
